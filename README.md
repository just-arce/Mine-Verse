# Mine-Verse
A Minecraft based game created by some community members.

Mine-Verse is a project that aims to create an alternative version of Minecraft. The idea is to offer players a way to permissively develop any type of modification. In addition, it seeks to leave the authentication system in the hands of each sub-project, since there are those who do not want to leave their information in Microsoft services (or any other).
